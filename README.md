# 🖥️ Chat Backend - Spring Boot + WebSocket

This is a simple real-time chat application built with **Spring Boot**. It uses **WebSockets** to provide live two-way communication between clients without refreshing the page.


This project was created as my first **usage of WebSockets** to learn the basics of real-time communication in full-stack applications. 🚀
